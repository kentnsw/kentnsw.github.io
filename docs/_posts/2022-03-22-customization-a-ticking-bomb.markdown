When using an open-source solution, we customise it more or less.

In the beginning, everything works perfectly. We are getting what we want, merging updates without any conflicts.

However, we all know that one day the upstream will change the same lines of code because of new features, refactoring, and/or re-design. Conflicts eventually will come. By that time, we might have already forgotten what were the changes and why they have been made.

The more changes we made, the big bomb it became.

Creating PRs to upstream is a way out. Bug fixes are easy to get through, enhancements are medium, new features are difficult.

What's the solution?
