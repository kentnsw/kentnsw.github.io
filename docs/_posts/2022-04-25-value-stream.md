The first thing of being value-focus is to understand the value stream, starting from the business objectives, then user stories, specifications, codes/applications/services, until the value is delivered to customers.

From this point of view, we're more like a delivery company, moving goods from point A to point B. The executive designs the high-level route to connect A and B. Each BU builds and operates part of the route. Goods are carried by trucks, trains (whatever tools) and be handover at the boarders.

We will need to understand the route to move towards the destination and avoid driving in circles. Every opportunity we have, every decision we make, we must evaluate them against the goal, the route, and make no distractions.

It can be tricky when trying to increase values. In a value stream, the values we delivered are measured by throughputs. It's like I am driving back home at peak hours, no matter how fast I drive in 99% of the route, I always get stuck in a traffic jam near a train station, an intersection
that merges 4 lanes into 2. The more lanes the other councils expended along the route, the more vehicles queued before the station. From a department's perspective, we're working day time, but in fact, more like driving at night. Most of the time we can only see where the headlamp is lighted.

Another issue is the priority. For the most valuable goods, we definitely want them to be delivered as soon as possible. However, information was always lost a bit and noise increased after the handover, which could affact all downstream decisions.
