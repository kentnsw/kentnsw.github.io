Communications across teams, departments are difficult as always.

You see a tap is leaking, at least in your opinion according to your professional judgment. But you can't just turn it off because that's not your tap. You look around, there are no signs indicating whom you can talk to. You ask around, but no responses or no useful responses.

You have been watching the water running for days, then weeks, then months. Finally, you doubt. You started to believe that is normal.

However, it's not. That's how an elephant dies.
