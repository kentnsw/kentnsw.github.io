I like kayaking. Usually, I collect bottles, balls and so on when I see them in the water. I went out kayaking today. It has been raining a lot recently and rubbish are everywhere. I collect none of them because that needs an industrial garbage collection boat to do the job. A kayak won't help.

If a neat code in dozens of lines were given, we can discuss a dozen of meaningful, inspiration issues. If hundreds of lines of rubbish were given, I'll have to say "it looks good to me. Keep up the good work".
